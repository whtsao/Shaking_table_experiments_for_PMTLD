Example: chy028-1-n
(Station name) - (Displacement direction and type) - (Test type)

# Station Names:
chy028 = Shan-Feng Elementary School, Yunlin County
chy088 = He-Dong Elementary School, Tainan
tcu052 = Guang-Zheng Elementary School, Taichung City
tcu065 = Wu-Feng Elementary School, Taichung City
tcu071 = Shuang-Dong Elementary School, Nantou County
tcu076 = Nantou Elementary School, Nantou County

# Displacement Direction and Type:
1 = Emd = East-West direction, modified
2 = Eor = East-West direction, original
3 = Nmd = North-South direction, modified
4 = Nor = North-South direction, original

# Test Types:
n  = Fresh-water TLD
nw = Uncontrolled (empty tank without water)
pm2 = PMTLD using stainless-steel mesh labeled PMTLD2 placed inside the tank

# Note:
All experiments were conducted using earthquake ground motions with a peak ground acceleration (PGA) of 0.1g.
